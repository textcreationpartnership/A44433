            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Chriſtian Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ALthough the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Sermons</hi> need no <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to commend them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny intelligent <hi>Reader,</hi> yet Cuſtom having made it neceſſary to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for the Satisfaction of the World, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb facs="tcp:53676:3"/>the <hi>Poſthumous Works</hi> of deceaſed Perſons, I ſhall therefore ſpeak a few Words briefly.</p>
            <p>The Reverend <hi>Prelate,</hi> the Author of them, was a Perſon of great Natural Parts, and Excellent Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as well as of great Piety and Charity: One that adorned the <hi>Church of England,</hi> whereof he was an Eminent <hi>Pillar,</hi> ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling well in the Church of God, and therefore deſerved <hi>double Honour,</hi> as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks: And doubtleſs, his Reward is now great in Heaven,
<pb facs="tcp:53676:3"/>with his Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, whoſe Service here on Earth was accounted by him as his higheſt Honour, and that which he profeſſed himſelf moſt ambitious of.</p>
            <p>He was a Perſon of great Modeſty and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; having very mean and low Thoughts of himſelf, and his own Abilities; which was the Reaſon why the World had ſo little Knowledge of him from the <hi>Preſs,</hi> having publiſhed nothing
<note n="*" place="margin">See his <hi>Vanity of the World,</hi> and <hi>A Funeral Sermon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Octavo.</hi>
               </note> but what he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to, either by the
<pb facs="tcp:53676:4"/>reſtleſs. Importunity of <hi>Friends,</hi> or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of thoſe that ſome Time were his <hi>Superiors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Intendment of this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> being not to give the World an Account of the Life of this Excellent Perſon, whoſe Praiſe is deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the <hi>Church of God,</hi> I forbear to add any thing farther concerning him, hoping it will ſhortly be done by a more worthy Pen.</p>
            <p>And as for the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Sermons,</hi> the excellent Style in which they are
<pb facs="tcp:53676:4"/>written, and the exact Accuracy with which they are penn'd, may give abundant Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto All, in the Reading of them, that they are His <hi>Lordſhip</hi>'s own, and were fairly written with his own Hand, and copied out from thence, ſince his <hi>Death,</hi> by one of his <hi>nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Relations,</hi> and ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto the Preſs.</p>
            <p>The Subject Matter of them being agreeable to the Divine Inſpirations of the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> will ſpeak better for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb facs="tcp:53676:5"/>than the Words of any other can. And that they may be very uſeful and profitable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe that heard them, and unto all that ſhall read them, is the hearty and ſincere Prayer of the <hi>Publiſher. Farewell.</hi>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53676:10"/>acceptations; and indeed the <hi>Scripture</hi> uſeth it in divers Senſes. Sometimes it ſignifies an abuſing of others, by violent and leud Actions: So we read that <hi>the Hebrew Servant,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Prov. 20.1.</note> Sometimes it ſignifies an impoſing upon the Credulity of others things that ſeem incredible and impoſſible: So we read in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> when <hi>Lot</hi> had declared to his Sons in Law the Deſtruction of <hi>Sodom,</hi> it is ſaid,

                     <note place="margin">Luk. 23.11.</note> as St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaks: Thus thoſe bleſſed <hi>Martyrs</hi> and <hi>Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,</hi> that followed his ſteps, are ſaid to have indured <hi>the trial of cruel Mockings,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 11.36.</note> as the Apoſtle tells us. And indeed this is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between a wiſe Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and a bitter Mocker; that the Words of the one are like

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Mocking may be taken for ſlighting, and making no account of, looking upon things or Perſons, as trivial and inconſiderable. And thus it is uſed in <hi>Job,</hi> where the <hi>Horſe</hi> is ſaid to <hi>mock at fear,</hi>

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, Sirs; The Sins that now abound in the World challenge our Tears and Pity: We ought to mourn and repent for thoſe who do not, who will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent for themſelves.

                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:53676:14"/>
                  <p>I know it will be here preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that ſurely it can be no ſuch great Crime to explode and hiſs Sin off the <hi>Stage;</hi> nay, it were a proper Means to keep Men from being generally ſo wicked, could we but make Wickedneſs more ridiculous in them.</p>
                  <p>But, alas! <hi>Vice</hi> is now-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days grown too impudent to be laughed out of Countenance; and thoſe Methods of a ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Mockery, which ſome plead for, as rendring Vice ridiculous, have, I doubt, only made it the more taking and ſpreading, and encouraged others to be the more openly ſinful, by teaching them to be the more wittily vile and wicked. Few will be deterred from ſinning, when they think they ſhall but gratifie others, by making Sport for them; and ſtir
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:53676:15"/>up, not their Indignation and Abhorrence, but their Mirth and Laughter. 'Tis true, we read that <hi>Elijah</hi> mock'd the Idolatrous Worſhippers of <hi>Baal,</hi> and his Scoffs and Taunts at them were very biting and <hi>ſarcastical,</hi> and cut them much deeper than they are ſaid to cut themſelves: But this he did in a ſerious and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous reproving of their Sins, not in a jocular and ſportive Merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There are two things in Sin, Impiety and Folly; we may lawfully enough ſcorn the one, while we are ſure to hate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt the other: And a due Mixture of both theſe together, Scorn and Deteſtation, are very fit to enkindle our Zeal for God, and may oftentimes be a requiſite Temper for him who is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove confident and audacious Sinners. But to laugh and ſport
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:53676:15"/>at others Wickedneſs, and to make the Guilt &amp; Shame of others our Mirth and Recreation, is both unchriſtian, and inhumane; and we may as well laugh at their Damnation, as at that which will lead them to it. Thus to make a Mock at Sin, is to make our very Mocks to be our Sins; and argues us, not only profane, but fooliſh; for this is to laugh and rejoyce at our own Stain and Diſhonour, and to abuſe our own Nature, that Nature which is common to us, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; that Nature which, were it not debaſed with Sin, renders us but a little lower than the <hi>Angels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What a fair and glorious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was Man, before Sin deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and ſullied him! A Friend to his God, Lord of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made a little lower than

And canſt thou laugh and ſport thy ſelf at that which hath ruin'd and undone thee, as well as others? Thy Nature is ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh'd and corrupted as much as theirs. When we look abroad in the World, and obſerve the abominable Wickedneſſes that are every where committed, the Murthers, Uncleanneſſes, Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies, Drunkenneſs, and all thoſe Prodigies of Impiety that every where ſwarm amongſt Men; how <hi>by Lying, Stealing, Swearing,

<note place="margin">Prov. 27.19.</note> Face anſwereth unto Face, ſo doth the Heart of Man to Man.</hi> We have therefore more reaſon to lament the Sins and Miſcarriages of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, than to make a Sport and Mock at their Wickedneſs, ſince we our ſelves are the very ſame, and prone enough, without the Reſtraining Grace of God, either to imitate, or exceed them.</p>

                     </note> Another thing that makes wicked Men think ſo ſlight of Sin, is that it cannot affect God with any real Injury; for as he is not benefited by our Services, ſo he is not wronged by our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities. 'Tis true, could our Sins reach God, could they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne him, or rend off any of his glorious Attributes from his immutable Eſſence, there might then be great Reaſon why God ſhould ſo ſeverely revenge them, and we for ever deteſt and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor them: But ſince his Glory is free from any Stain, and his Being from any Wrong and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, our Sins are nothing to him, nor is there any Reaſon we ſhould judge them heinous and provoking.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Here is the Proof of this Propoſition, in theſe Words, that <hi>They have a Right to the Tree of Life, and ſhall enter through the Gates into the City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the Connection of both theſe together, that I intend chiefly to ſpeak unto. Only give me leave, as a Preliminary to the enſuing Diſcourſe, to ſhew you what is contained in the firſt and great Word in my <hi>Text;</hi> and that is the Word <hi>Bleſſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is therefore a twofold <hi>Beatitude,</hi> or <hi>Bleſſedneſs:</hi> The one is <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>conſummate;</hi> the other <hi>initial</hi> and <hi>incompleat.</hi> The former is the Complection of all Good perfective of our Natures, and our entire and ſatisfying En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it. This Bleſſedneſs
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53676:32"/>now is only attainable in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; for God alone is the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of all Good, and all the Good that is deſirable in this World, are but ſo many Lines drawn from the Centre, to the utmoſt Circumference of the Creation. There is nothing that can ſupply the Wants, perform the Hopes, fulfil the Deſires, without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement circumſcribe, without Cloying ſatisfie the moſt enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Capacities of a Rational Soul, but only that God who is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, univerſally, and indefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively good; and therefore he alone is our objective Happineſs: and our formal Happineſs is our Relation to, and Union with this All comprehenſive and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible Good. Our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilation to him, and Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation from him, of all thoſe Perfections which our Natures
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:53676:33"/>are capable of enjoying, but our Underſtandings not now capable of knowing. But this <hi>conſummate Bleſſedneſs,</hi> is reſerved for our unknown Reward hereafter, and is not that which my <hi>Text</hi> here ſpeaks of.</p>
                  <p>There is therefore an <hi>imperfect</hi> and <hi>initial Bleſſedneſs,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in a Preparation for, and a Tendency unto the other: As thoſe are ſaid to be accurſed, whoſe Sins and Vices prepare them for Eternal Perdition; ſo thoſe likewiſe are ſaid to be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, whoſe Grace and Holineſs prepare them for Eternal Bliſs and Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Now ſuch as theſe are bleſſed in a fourfold Reſpect.

                        <hi>Bleſſed in Hope.</hi> Titus 2.13.</note> They are bleſſed <hi>in Spe,</hi> in Hope; whence it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Apoſtle, <hi>That bleſſed Hope.</hi> A bleſſed Hope it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that which we hope for is <hi>Eternal Bleſſedneſs.</hi> The Hope of worldly Things is commonly more tormenting, than the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of them can be ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It is an Hope that vitiates and deflowers its Object, and ſo
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53676:35"/>mightily over-rates them in the Fancy, that when they come to paſs, our Hope is rather fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than accompliſhed: And were it not for that Impatience, which is the conſtant Attendant of this Hope, it would be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem hard to be reſolved, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Expectation or Fruition were the more eligible Eſtate. Vain therefore and wretched muſt needs be the Hopes of thoſe things, which cannot anſwer what is expected from them; like a Golden Dream to a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, or the Dream of a furniſh'd Table to one that is hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarv'd. But now the Hopes of Heaven can never impoveriſh the Glories of it, for they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and inexhauſtible; and God hath laid up for his, that which the Heart of Man cannot conceive.</p>

                  <p>A Chriſtian's Hope hath two Prerogatives above any worldly Hope.

                  </p>
                  <p>One is, That it may attain to a full and final Aſſurance, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> where he calls it,
<note place="margin">Heb. 6.11.</note> 
                     <hi>The full Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Hope unto the End.</hi> An Hope it is, becauſe the Object of it is a future Good deſired and expected: But yet it is an Hope that is joined with a full Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Event; an Hope that may flower up into ſuch a Certainty, as to have no Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Fear or Doubting in its Compoſition; but may be as ſure of the Heavenly Inheritance, as if our Reverſion were already in actual Poſſeſſion: Whereas Worldly Hope can never be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, but ſome Providence or other may interpoſe, to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point it.</p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:53676:36"/>
                  <p>The other <hi>Prerogative</hi> of a Chriſtian's Hope, is, that though it be thus fully aſſured, yet the Accompliſhment of it ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have the ſweet Reliſh of Surpriſe and Wonder; for the Happineſs will be far greater than the Hope, and the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance larger than the Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whereas Earthly Hopes, if they grow to any degree of Confidence of Succeſs, upon Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration they turn into Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Rage: Or if perhaps they do ſucceed, the Sweetneſs of the Accompliſhment was long before ſuck'd out and devoured by our greedy Expectation; the <hi>Game</hi> is torn and eaten, before the <hi>Huntſ-man</hi> can come in. And upon both theſe Accounts, the pious and obedient Chriſtian is bleſſed in Hope: It is a bleſſed Hope that ſhall certainly be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53676:36"/>and a bleſſed Hope, the accompliſhing of which ſhall infinitely exceed our Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and fill us, not with Shame, but Eternal Admiration and Wonder.</p>

No, it doth no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice unto Faith; for we ſtill affirm, that our original and fundamental Right to Heaven is grounded, not upon our Obedience, but Chriſt's; not upon our Works, but upon his; his Merits and Purchaſe, which, through Faith, are imparted and imputed to us. Yet give me leave to ſay, that I think the Notion of Juſtifying and Saving Faith is very much, if not generally miſtaken by us: And as the Soul is the moſt noble, and moſt vital Principle of Man, and yet is moſt unknown to him what it is, and how it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates; ſo Faith, which is the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Principle of Chriſtians, and by which the Juſt are ſaid to live, is yet moſt unknown, both as to its Nature and Operations, unto the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53676:48"/>Generality of them: Some place it in Aſſurance, ſome in Affiance and Recumbence; ſome in one Act of Faith, and ſome in another; which are either the Effects of Faith as true, or the Degrees of it as ſtrong, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the proper and adequate Nature and Eſſence of it; and then they mightily puzzle themſelves how to accord and reconcile Faith and Obedience in carrying on the great Work of our Salvation, which yet were never at a variance about it, but only in their miſtaken <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis:</hi> For what is Faith, but an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to a Teſtimony? The very force and import of the Word can carry no other Senſe: And he that ſaith he believes, muſt needs mean he believes ſome Record or Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; or elſe he ſpeaks that which neither himſelf, nor any other can underſtand. Conſequently there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Divine Faith muſt be an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53676:49"/>to a Divine Teſtimony; that is, to the Word of God contained in the Holy Scriptures. But now if this Faith reſt only in a bare and naked Aſſent to the Truth of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, it is but Hiſtorical and Dogmatical; which, though it be a Divine Faith in reſpect of the Objects believed, yet is it but Humane and Natural in reſpect of its Principle and Motives. But when this Aſſent to the Truths of the Scripture is joined with propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Affections to thoſe Truths, and doth excite us to Actions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Diſcoveries of the Divine Will, there this Faith is Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying and Saving. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is not ſo very diſtant from Obedience, as to be thought hardly reconcileable with it. As for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, A Man may give a bare Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to this great Goſpel-Truth, that <hi>Jeſus Christ came into the World to ſave
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53676:49"/>Sinners,</hi> and yet this Faith may not ſave him, becauſe it may be unope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, and paſs no farther than the Act of the Underſtanding: This is a dead Faith, which can never bring any Man to Heaven; yea, ſuch a Faith as the very <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>Damned</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jam. 2.19</note> 
                     <hi>Spirits</hi> in Hell have, <hi>who believe and tremble.</hi> Another Man believes the ſame Truth, and aſſents to the ſame Propoſition; but this his Aſſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenceth his Affections, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns his Actions, in Conformity to the Nature and Conſequences of ſuch a Belief: And becauſe he is aſſured that Jeſus Chriſt came into the World to be the Saviour of it, therefore he loves him, truſts in him, relies upon him, hopes in his Promiſes, and obeys his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. And this, indeed,

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53676:50"/>Scriptures, working in us propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Affections and Actions. He who ſo believes <hi>the Glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> as to have his Endeavours thereby quickned to uſe his utmoſt Diligence for the obtaining of it: He who ſo believes <hi>the Torments of Hell,</hi> as thereby to be terrified from doing any thing that might expoſe him to ſo great and fearful a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: He who ſo believes <hi>the Attributes of God,</hi> as thereby to be excited to fear him for his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to love him for his Goodneſs, to imitate him in his Bounty, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and Holineſs: He who ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves <hi>the All-ſufficiency, Merits, and Mediatory Office of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as thereby to be engaged with all his Soul to love him, to truſt in him, to rely upon him alone for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and to yield to him all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Obedience, as the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; ſuch an ones Faith is Saving

What is the End of all this, but to preſs you to true practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Holineſs, and a ſtrict Obedience to the Commandments of God?

Where is the Man that would not teſtifie the Confidence of his Hopes, by his Diſdain at the <hi>Queſtion?</hi> Yea, but remember that Salvation is a litigious Claim, and you have a powerful Adverſary that puts in a ſtrong Plea againſt you, even the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, and his Eternal Wrath and Vengeance; whoſe Title to us,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53676:51"/>were it but better weighed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, would wofully ſtagger the Hopes of moſt Men, and make their Faces gather Blackneſs, and ſmite their Hearts with Amazement, and their Knees with Trembling.

                  <p>The <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> whom <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls the <hi>Patrons of Hereticks,</hi> have eſtabliſhed two peremptory <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims,</hi> utterly repugnant unto what the <hi>Scripture</hi> reveals to us, both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Happineſs &amp; Comfort: The one is, <hi>Ex nihilo, nihil habetur: Out of nothing, nothing can be made;</hi> direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly levell'd againſt the Creation of the World.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53676:54"/>to common Senſe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded it as ridiculous and impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.

                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.24.</note> complaining that the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who were then the great Maſters of Wiſdom and Learning, eſteemed a crucified Chriſt Fooliſhneſs, and thought thoſe Men little befriended by <hi>Reaſon,</hi> that would depend for Life upon one that loſt his own; and venture to take off the Shamefulneſs of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> or to ſilence thoſe Scoffs that were caſt upon them for their Credulity, who affirm the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of a dead Saviour, and his glorious Triumph over <hi>Death</hi> and the <hi>Grave.</hi> For this ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them no other than to ſolve an Abſurdity by an Impoſſibility, and make Reaſon more ſuſpicious, in that they judged the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals of <hi>Reaſon</hi> muſt be overthrown, to make the Fundamentals of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity</hi> any way tolerable or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.

 It was impoſſible Chriſt ſhould be held under the Power of Death, becauſe of that great and ineffable Myſtery of the Hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Union of the Divine and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature in the Perſon of Chriſt.

                     </note> There are three <hi>Unions,</hi> the Belief of which are the Foundation of the greateſt part of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> which are wholly beyond the reach of Reaſon: The <hi>Mystical Union</hi> of a Believer unto Chriſt: The <hi>Union,</hi> or rather <hi>Unity</hi> of the three Glorious Perſons, <hi>the Father, the Son,</hi> and <hi>the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> in one Nature; and this <hi>Hypoſtatical Union</hi> of two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in one Perſon, in the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. It is a Myſtery <hi>Angels</hi> pry into,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53676:60"/>and adore, with Wonder and Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, how the Eternal, only begotten Son of God ſhould aſſume Fleſh to himſelf, in ſo cloſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate a Conjunction, that though he be Eternal, yet he ſhould be born; though he be Immortal, yet he ſhould truly die; and though he were truly dead, yet he ſhould raiſe himſelf to Life again. Theſe are things that ſeem very inconſiſtent one with another, yet they truly come to paſs through this miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Union, which tranſcends the Reach of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as far as theſe things do that of Nature.

The Divine Nature was united to the Body of Christ, when the Soul was ſeparated from it.</hi>

If Chriſt could not have rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf, it muſt have been ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from a Want of Power, or from a Want of Will to do it. He could not want Power to raiſe himſelf, becauſe he was God, equal in Power, and in all other Divine At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, with the Father. As the <hi>Reſurrection of the Dead</hi> is not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to the infinite Power of God, ſo neither can it be that that God who had a Will to aſſume our Fleſh, ſhould want a Will to raiſe it up: That that God who ſo lov'd the Humane Nature, as to aſſociate it into Oneneſs of Perſon with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſhould yet ſuffer it to continue under the power of <hi>Death,</hi> which is, of all things, moſt contrary to his natural Inclinations. We ſee Chriſt, in his Agony, prayed moſt fervently that the bitter Cup might paſs from him, inſomuch that he ſtrained clotted Blood through
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:53676:61"/>him; and certainly, one Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient into that Cup was the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Soul and Body by <hi>Death;</hi> which is that which even innocent Nature it ſelf abhorred, as deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to him; yet having taken our Nature upon him for this very End, that <hi>by Death he might deſtroy him that had the power of Death, that is,
<note place="margin">Heb. 2, 14.</note> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> he voluntarily ſubmitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to undergo it; and this End be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully accompliſh'd by his <hi>Death,</hi> and the Truth of his <hi>Death</hi> likewiſe atteſted by his lying three Days in the Earth, it was altogether impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that that Perſon who had an Abhorrence of Death, and a Power to raiſe himſelf, ſhould continue longer under the Arreſt and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of it. And this is the <hi>firſt</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the Neceſſity of the Reſurrection of Chriſt, upon the Account of both Natures in one Perſon: As Man, ſo he abhorred
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:53676:62"/>the Separation of Soul and Body; as God, ſo he was able to re-unite them: So that having, as Man, a Deſire to live, and as God, a Power to live, it was impoſſible for him to be holden of <hi>Death.</hi>

Becauſe of the Union of the Divine and Humane Nature in the Perſon of Chriſt, it was impoſſible that his Fleſh ſhould ſee Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; which yet it muſt certainly have done, had he not been raiſed in a ſhort ſpace after his Death. For ſince Chriſt's Body was not a phantaſtical Body, as ſome of old held, but made of true Fleſh, and of the ſame Temper and Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with ours, it muſt, without a <hi>Miracle,</hi> have undergone ſuch Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges after <hi>Death</hi> as ours ſhall do; and to imagine the contrary, is but to feign one <hi>Miracle,</hi> to avoid the neceſſity of another, even of the <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> But now, it was ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53676:62"/>impoſſible that that Body that was united to both Natures, by ſo cloſe and unconceivable a Bond, ſhould ever ſee Corruption; that is, a Putrefaction in the Grave: This the <hi>Scripture</hi> clearly aſſerts to us;
<note place="margin">Act. 2.28.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell, neither wilt thou ſuffer thine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly One to ſee Corruption.</hi> And alſo, becauſe all Bodies that are corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted turn into ſome other Thing, and ſome other Nature, according to that undoubted Maxim of the <hi>Philoſophers, Corruptio unius eſt Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio alterius:</hi> And ſo this horrid and blaſphemous Conſequence would follow, that the Divine Nature of the Son of God might have been joyned to ſome other. So that it was neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould be raiſed again, before any Corruption or Putrefaction, by ordinary Courſe of Nature, ſiezed upon him.</p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:53676:63"/>
                  <p>Thus I have proved by theſe <hi>two Arguments,</hi> that becauſe of the <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatical Union</hi> of the Divine and Humane Nature of Chriſt in one Perſon, it was altogether impoſſible he could be holden of <hi>Death.</hi>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another <hi>Argument</hi> is this, It was impoſſible Chriſt ſhould be holden of <hi>Death,</hi> becauſe of God's Veracity, and the Truth of thoſe Predictions which were before made concerning Chriſt, in thoſe many <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Propheſies</hi> of the <hi>Old Teſtament;</hi> all which God's Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs ſtood engaged to fulfil. I ſhall only mention that famous <hi>Prediction</hi> which St. <hi>Peter</hi> here ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins, as a Proof of the Subject I am now treating upon: <hi>It was not poſſible,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 2 25, 27.</note> ſays he, <hi>that Chriſt ſhould be holden of Death;</hi> for God, ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſaith concerning him; <hi>Thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell, nor ſuffer thine Holy One to ſee
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53676:63"/>Corruption.</hi> And this <hi>Propheſie</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> quotes out of the <hi>Pſalmiſt;</hi>

                     <hi>Ver.</hi> 29, 30. of this <hi>Chapter;</hi> where he proves that <hi>David</hi> was dead and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and underwent the common Lot that all other dead Bodies did, putrefying and mouldering away in the Earth; and therefore he was not that <hi>Holy One</hi> that ſhould never ſee Corruption, becauſe that <hi>Prophecy</hi> muſt belong to ſuch an one who muſt ſo taſte of <hi>Death;</hi> and this is clearly implied in the former Expreſſion, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell,</hi> that is, in the State of the Dead, for ſo is Hell to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood there, as I ſhall ſhew more at large: Neither could it belong to any of thoſe who, before Chriſt, were raiſed miraculouſly
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53676:64"/>from the Dead, and brought back out of the State of <hi>Death;</hi> yet was it not in ſuch a manner, that they were not to return again to it: So that if they did not in the firſt, yet in their ſecond Dying they ſaw Corruption. This then could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to none of them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt of neceſſity belong to Chriſt. And ſince the <hi>Apostle</hi> lays ſo much ſtreſs on this Argument, give me leave a little to conſider the meaning of it, and how it is applicable to him. And here I ſhall not trouble you with the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Opinions</hi> of thoſe that have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to interpret theſe Words, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell;</hi> that by this <hi>Hell,</hi> into which Chriſt deſcended, is meant the place of the Damned, where he preached the <hi>Goſpel</hi> to them, freeing thoſe that would beleive from their Pains. Others think that this Hell, into
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53676:64"/>which Chriſt deſcended, was one great Partition of it, called <hi>Lymbus Patrum,</hi> the Repoſitory of the Souls of thoſe <hi>Fathers</hi> who died in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to God, and in Faith to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> before Chriſt came in the Fleſh: And the Reaſon of his Deſcent thither was, that he might releaſe thoſe Souls from Chains, and carry them with him to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; ſo that ever ſince, that <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> in <hi>Hell</hi> hath been left void, without any Inhabitants. But this <hi>Opinion</hi> is not capable of any ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Proof; I ſhall therefore give you that Interpretation and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which carries with it the ſtrongeſt Current, both of <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reaſon.</hi> The Word <hi>Hades,</hi> that we <hi>tranſlate Hell,</hi> is very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, by the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> uſed to ſignifie the <hi>Grave,</hi> or the State of the Dead. So in <hi>Gen.</hi> 44. <hi>Iſhades,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 44 31</note> we <hi>tranſlate</hi> it the

                     <hi>Grave,</hi> but it is the ſame Word that is uſed for <hi>Hell</hi> in the <hi>Text.</hi> And thus the Word is uſed in other places of <hi>Scripture,</hi> as alſo in other <hi>Authors,</hi> to ſignifie the Place and State of the <hi>Dead,</hi> and of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Souls. And for the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Soul of Chriſt in <hi>Hades,</hi> or in <hi>Hell,</hi> we muſt know, that it is a thing that is not unuſual in <hi>Scripture,</hi> to call a Man that is <hi>dead</hi> by the Name of <hi>Soul:</hi> So the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuagint</hi> tranſlate that place in <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus,
<note place="margin">Levit. 21.11.</note> They ſhall not be defiled with dead Souls,</hi> meaning dead Carca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>neither ſhall they go into any dead Souls,</hi> the Word is dead Bodies. But not to detain you any longer on this Speculation, though of great uſe for the right underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of this excellent place of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture:</hi> If we take <hi>Hell</hi> for the <hi>Grave,</hi> we muſt take the <hi>Soul</hi> for the <hi>Body; Thou wilt not leave my Body
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:53676:65"/>in the Grave:</hi> But if by <hi>Hell</hi> be here underſtood the State of <hi>Death,</hi> that is, the State of Separation of <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> the Interpretation will be more eaſie and natural, <hi>Thou wilt not leave my Soul</hi> in a State of Separation from the <hi>Body,</hi> but wilt certainly unite them together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and raiſe me up before I ſhall feel Corruption. Thus I have given you the Interpretation of the <hi>Prophecy</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> which, upon the Account of God's Truth and Veracity, was to take effect in the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of our Saviour; and therefore being foretold <hi>he ſhould not ſee Corruption,</hi> the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of God was obliged within that time inviolably to raiſe him up.

                     </note> Another <hi>Argument</hi> is this: <hi>It was impoſſible Christ could be holden by Death, upon the Account of God's Juſtice.</hi> For Juſtice, as it doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige to inflict Puniſhment upon the Guilty, ſo alſo to abſolve and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit the Innocent. Now, though Chriſt <hi>knew no Sin,</hi> yet was he <hi>made Sin for us;</hi> that is, our Sins were imputed to, and charged upon him, and ſo, through a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Suſception and Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them, he became guilty of them: Hereupon Divine Juſtice ſiezed upon him, as being our Surety, and demanded Satisfaction from him for our Offences: Now no other Satisfaction would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53676:66"/>unto God, nor commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate to our Sins, but the bearing of an infinite Load of Wrath and Vengeance; which if it had been laid upon us, muſt have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to an Eternity of Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings; for becauſe we are finite Creatures, we cannot bear infinite Degrees of Wrath at once, and therefore we muſt have lain under thoſe infinite Degrees of Wrath to an infinite Duration: But now Chriſt being God, he could bear the Load of infinite Degrees of Wrath at once upon him. In that one bitter Draught, the whole Cup of that Fury and Wrath of God, that we ſhould have been everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingly a drinking off, by little Drops, Chriſt drank off at once. Now it is the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of all <hi>Laws,</hi> that when a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by undergoing the Penalty that

There was nothing in the World did ſo much prejudice the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its taking place in the Hearts of <hi>Heathens</hi> in the <hi>Primitive Times,</hi> as this of the Croſs and Death of Chriſt; for believing that he was lifted up upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> but not believing that he was raiſed up from the <hi>Dead,</hi> they aſſented to their <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſon,</hi> which herein taught them, that it was Folly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53676:69"/>Life from him who could not either preſerve or reſtore his own.</p>
                  <p>It is true, it was Folly thus to hope, but that his Life applies what his Death deſerv'd; and our Salvation begun on the Croſs, is perfected on the Throne. And therefore the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.17.</note> our Faith in a crucified Saviour, and our Obedience to him is all vain, if he had not riſen again from the Dead: For unleſs he had riſen from the Dead, he could not have acquitted us from the Guilt of Sin, becauſe he could not have been ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified himſelf. We are juſtified by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks, in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom 4 25</note> which Righteouſneſs he wrought out for us, both by his perfect Obedience to the Law, and by his Submiſſion to the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53676:70"/>of the Law: But yet this Righteouſneſs could not have avai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to our Juſtification, had he not, after the Fulfilling of it, riſen again from the Dead; becauſe he himſelf had not been juſtified, much leſs could we have been ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by one who could not have juſtified himſelf. And therefore we read,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16.</note> 
                     <hi>Great is the Mystery of Godlineſs,</hi> ſays the <hi>Apoſtle; God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the Fleſh,</hi> in his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>justified in the Spirit,</hi> by his Reſurrection; <hi>ſeen of Angels,</hi> in his Aſcenſion. Had he not been rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and quickned by the Spirit, that is, by the glorious Power of his Divine Nature, he had not been declared juſt, nor could he have juſtified us: For this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that Chriſt was juſt, was made upon the Reſurrection of his Body from the Dead, by which he
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53676:70"/>was ſet free from all thoſe Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties due to our Sins that were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him. If therefore the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and Salvation of Sinners was a Deſign laid by the infinite Wiſdom of God, it muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that it was impoſſible for Chriſt to be kept under Death, becauſe that would have obſtructed their Juſtification and Salvation, and ſo would have brought a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment upon the infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, which was impoſſible to be done; and therefore conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentially Chriſt could not be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of Death.</p>

If it was impoſſible for Chriſt not to have riſen from
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53676:71"/>the Dead, it is evident then that Chriſt is the true <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> For had he been an Impoſtor, or <hi>Falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi> it would have been ſo far from an Impoſſibility that he ſhould not have been raiſed, that it would have been a very Impoſſibility for him to have riſen again; for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could he have raiſed himſelf, being a mere Man; neither would God have raiſed him, being a mere <hi>Impostor</hi> and <hi>Cheat.</hi> When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Jews</hi> call'd for a <hi>Sign</hi> from Chriſt, to prove him to be the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> he gives them the Sign of his Reſurrection, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.38, 39. <hi>Maſter,
<note place="margin">Matth. 12.38, 39.</note> ſay they, we would ſee a Sign from thee. He anſwered and ſaid unto them, An evil and adulterous Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration ſeeketh after a Sign, and there ſhall be no Sign given to it, but the Sign of the Prophet</hi> Jonas: <hi>For as</hi> Jonas <hi>was three Days and three Nights
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53676:71"/>in the Whale's Belly, ſo ſhall the Son of Man be three Days and three Nights in the Heart of the Earth.</hi> So again, when they tempted him at another time, for a <hi>Sign</hi> of his being the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> he ſtill inſtances in his powerful Reſurrection from the Dead, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.18, 19.
<note place="margin">Joh. 2.18, 19.</note> 
                     <hi>The Jews anſwered and ſaid unto him, What Sign ſheweſt thou unto us, ſeeing thou doeſt theſe things.

If it were neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould riſe from the Dead, and that he did do ſo, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Sin is conquered; for the Sting of Death, and that enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom'd Weapon Death hath,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53676:72"/>whereby it wounds, yea kills the Sinner, is Sin; and as long as Death hath this Sting in it, it could not have been conquer'd by any Sinner. It is Sin that gives Death its Power to hold faſt all thoſe that come within its reach; which ſince it could not do with Chriſt, it is evident Sin is ſubdued by Chriſt, who was in its Arms and Graſp, but yet came ſafe out from it, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the Sting and Weapon of Death with him.</p>

If the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> be thus neceſſary, and hath been thus effectually accompliſhed, we may comfortably from thence conclude the Neceſſity of our own <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> for the Head being raiſed, the Members ſhall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſleep in the Duſt.

Now ſuch as theſe are paſt <hi>Reproof,</hi>

The greateſt exerciſe of <hi>Charity</hi> to theſe, is to let them alone, and not to increaſe their Damnation, by ſtirring up the virulency and rancour of their Spirits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reproof</hi> is ſpiritual <hi>Phyſick</hi> for the Soul. Now as it is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent Courſe to adminiſter ſuch <hi>Phyſick</hi> to the Body, as will irritate, and not expel the pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Humours: So likewiſe it is very imprudent and unſafe, to adminiſter ſuch <hi>Reproofs</hi> as we know cannot cure the Offender, but will only irritate his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and render it the more turbulent, and him much worſe than he was before. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome are themſelves to be reproved, who with an impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Zeal reprove others, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53676:89"/>ever conſidering what Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects their <hi>Reproofs</hi> are likely to produce, who, as ſoon as a Sin is committed, think themſelves obliged in Conſcience, inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to rebuke them for it, although not only they themſelves may be reviled, but the Name of God moſt horribly blaſphemed upon this very Occaſion. It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>good to be zealouſly affected always in a good Matter.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 4.18.</note> But yet withal know, that as Zeal and Charity ought to be the Motive, ſo Chriſtian Prudence ought to be the Meaſure of all our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs.</hi> And if you take not the Advice of Diſcretion, your Zeal for God's Glory may but occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion his Diſhonour; and your Charity to the Souls of others, occaſion their ſorer Ruine and Damnation. Certainly we are not obliged to reprove where
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:53676:90"/>we have reaſon to ſuſpect we ſhall rather do hurt than good. It would be but a cruel Charity, to poiſon our Brother in his <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and to kill him in his Cure. And therefore both <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> and a greater than <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> our <hi>Saviour Chriſt</hi> himſelf, have forbidden us to miſplace <hi>Reproofs</hi> upon thoſe who are deſperate. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs</hi> 9.7, <note place="margin">Prov. 9.7.</note> 8. <hi>He that reproveth a Scorner, getteth to himſelf Shame; and he that rebuketh a wicked Man, getteth unto himſelf a Blot.</hi> And again, <hi>Reprove not a Scorner, leſt he hate thee.</hi> And ſays our Saviour,

<note place="margin">Gal. 6.1.</note> 
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Brethren, if a Man be overtaken in a fault, you that are ſpiritual, reſtore ſuch an one in the ſpirit of Meekneſs, conſidering thy ſelf, leſt thou be alſo tempted,</hi> Which laſt Clauſe intimates to us, that we ought to deal as ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly with a fallen Brother, as we would deſire to be dealt with our ſelves, were we in the ſame condition. For having the ſame corrupt Nature, and being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the like Temptations, we
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53676:94"/>may likewiſe, through God's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliction of us, fall into the ſame Miſcarriages. Now wouldſt thou take it well, if any ſhould revile and reprove thee, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thee for a rotten Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, as <hi>Job</hi>'s Friends did him; or draw hideous black Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences from every failing and weakneſs of thine? Certainly thou wouldſt not interpret this to be friendly and candid deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: No more do thou with others. It is a true Saying, that he who would know his own Faults, had need have either a faithful Friend, or a bitter Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; they will both be ſure to do it to the full. But then the difference is, that an Enemy's <hi>Reproofs</hi> are uſually joined with <hi>Reproaches,</hi> and when we are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, he will ſtand and inſult over us. But a true Chriſtian
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53676:95"/>Friend will faithfully repreſent our condition to us, pitty us in it, and endeavour to help and raiſe us out of it. And ſuch ſhould we be to all, not railing on them for Hypocrites, or loſt and deſperate Apoſtates, for this certainly is not the way to reduce them, but rather to confirm and harden them in their Sins. We ſhould not gripe nor preſs their Wounds, but rather gently anoint and chafe them. Our <hi>Reproofs</hi> ſhould be as Oyl, ſmooth and lenitive, to ſoak into and ſupple the Part affected. And therefore the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> again exhorts us, <hi>in meekneſs to inſtruct thoſe that oppoſe themſelves.</hi>

We ought ſo to reprove, that he may not think we only jeſt and dally with him, and for this it is neceſſary that we do it with all Seriouſneſs, Gravity and Authority, not playing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Wound, but ſearching

<note place="margin">Tit. 1.13.</note> 
                     <hi>Rebuke them ſharply, that they may be ſound in the Faith.</hi> If they want Salt and Vinegar, ſpare them not. This poſſibly may cleanſe thoſe Wounds that elſe would feſter and putrify.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53676:96"/>and ſearcht to the very Quick before they can be healed. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers require a gentle Hand. If they be proud and ſtubborn, they need Corroſives. But for thoſe who are naturally meek and mild, a meek and mild Courſe will be eaſieſt and moſt effectual. The Tempers and Caſes of particular Chriſtians are ſo various, that there can be no Rules given that may be applicable to every Condition. This muſt of neceſſity be left to your Prudence and Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Only this Rule is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Be ſure you flatter none in their Vices, extenuate not their Sins; when thou com'ſt to <hi>reprove</hi> them, do it not in ſport: Let them ſee thou art in very good earneſt, and tell them their Sin, as it is in it ſelf, without min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the matter, or the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53676:97"/>of it. For Men are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways apt to impute ſomewhat of the <hi>Reproof</hi> to the ſeverity of him that gives it, rather than to the demerits of their own Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And therefore, if thou thy ſelf ſhalt ſpeak but ſlightly of their Sins, they will be ready to conclude that they were none, or at leaſt ſo ſmall, that it was nothing but Officiouſneſs, and the love of Cenſuring made thee take notice of them.</p>

But becauſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity is periſht from off the Earth, and Men are generally more apt to be wrought upon by Arguments drawn from Fear than Love, therefore the <hi>Scripture</hi> propounds to us the conſideration of the dreadful Juſtice of God arrayed in all the terrible Circumſtances of it, that if Mercy cannot allure us, Juſtice at leaſt might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright us from our Sins. And as thoſe who are to travel tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <hi>Wilderneſſes</hi> and <hi>Deſerts,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Fire with them to terrify wild and ravenous Beaſts, and to ſecure themſelves from their Aſſaults: So doth the great God, who hath to deal with brutiſh Men, Men more ſavage than wild Beaſts, he kindles a Fire about him, and appears to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53676:106"/>them all in Flames and Fury; that ſo he might fright them from their bold Attempts, who otherwiſe would be ready, <hi>to run upon his Neck and upon the thick Boſſes of his Buckler.</hi>

It is a State ſo full of perfect Miſery, that Miſery it ſelf is too eaſy a Name to give it; yea, whatſoever we can ſpeak moſt appoſitly of it, is but diminiſhing it; for becauſe it is the <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi> of an infinite God, it can no more be known by us, than
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:53676:108"/>God himſelf. Plunge your Thoughts as deep into it as you can, yet ſtill there remains an infinite <hi>Abyſſe</hi> which you can never fathom. And O that the conſideration of this <hi>Wrath</hi> might cauſe us all to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before this great and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God, that we might ſo fear it, as never to feel it; and be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to fall down at his Feet, that we may never fall into his Hands. And that we may be thus affected, I have choſen this <hi>Text</hi> to ſet forth the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Dreadfulneſs of that Wrath and Vengeance which the righteous God will execute upon all ſtubborn and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Wretches.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Text</hi> that ſpeaks to us, as God did to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> out of the midſt of the Fire and Blackneſs, Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53676:108"/>and Tempeſt, in the Voice of a Trumpet. And truly we have all need to have ſuch rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Truths frequently inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon us, for the beſt of us are <hi>Lethargical,</hi> and though ſometimes when our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are pincht hard by a ſevere and ſearching Truth, we ſtart up and look abroad, yet as ſoon as the preſent Impreſſion is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, we ſuddenly cloſe our Eyes, and fall aſleep again in Sin and Security. There is a ſtrange Dullneſs and Stupor hath ſeiz'd us, that we can no longer keep waking than we are ſhook.</p>
                  <p>And therefore as we uſe to apply Fire and burning Coals to <hi>Lethargick</hi> Perſons to awaken them; ſo we have need to heap <hi>Coals of Fire</hi> upon Mens Heads, to ſpeak with <hi>fiery Tongues,</hi> and thunder Woe and

                  </p>
                  <p>I begin with the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, God's appropriating and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging Vengeance unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompence, ſaith the Lord.</hi> Which Paſſage the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> cites out of <hi>Deuteronomy ch.</hi>

                     <hi>To me belongeth Vengeance and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, and the Lord ſhall judge his People.</hi> It is his great and royal Prerogative that he doth ſometimes make uſe of in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting Judgments upon the Wicked in this World, but moſt eſpecially in the World to come. And to this future Vengeance, the Words ought particularly to be applyed. Now from this conſideration, That Vengeance in a peculiar Manner belongs unto the great God, hence we may obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That God himſelf will be the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Inflicter of the Puniſhments of the Damned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is therefore here likewiſe called a <hi>falling into the Hands of the living God,</hi> which denotes his immediate Efficiency in their Torments.</p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:53676:110"/>
                  <p>It is true, God doth uſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Inſtruments of Torture in Hell. There is the <hi>Worm that never dies,</hi> and <hi>the Fire that never goes out,</hi> which I ſuppoſe to be not only a <hi>Metaphorical,</hi> but poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly a <hi>Material Fire,</hi> elevated to ſuch a degree of Subtilty, as that it ſhall at once torture the Soul, and not conſume the Body.

                     <hi>Who among us ſhall dwell with the devouring Fire? who among us ſhall dwell with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Burnings?</hi> Would not one think at the very firſt ſound of the Words, that the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſpeaks only of ſuch as ſhould be damned, of ſuch as ſhould be caſt into Hell, to remain there in everlaſting Fire and Burnings? And demands of them, who among them could endure this? No, but it appears plainly, that this <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is in Heaven it ſelf, and the <hi>Prophet</hi> by putting this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53676:111"/>
                     <hi>Who ſhall dwell with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Fire and everlaſting Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings?</hi> asks who ſhall be ſaved, and not who ſhall be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? And therefore in the 15th <hi>Verſe,</hi> he tells us, that he ſhall do it, <hi>who walketh uprightly, and ſpeaketh uprightly, that deſpiſeth the gain of Oppreſſion, that ſhaketh his Hands from holding of Bribes, that ſtoppeth his Ears from hearing of Blood, and ſhutteth his Eyes from ſeeing of Evil.</hi> Such a one ſhall dwell with the devouring Fire; that is, he ſhall for ever dwell and remain with God in Heaven. So that we ſee God is a <hi>Fire</hi> both to the Wicked, and to the Godly; to the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked he is a <hi>penetrating torturing Fire,</hi> and they are combuſtible Matter for the Wrath and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God to prey upon; but to the Godly he is a <hi>purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53676:111"/>and cheriſhing Fire</hi> only.

And though I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not but there may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like that which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly apprehend when we ſpeak of <hi>Hell,</hi> ſome unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Flames prepared by the Wiſdom and Power of God for the eternal Torment of thoſe Wretches that ſhall be caſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into; yet withal I think that their moſt exquiſite Torments ſhall be from that <hi>Fire</hi> that is God himſelf.</p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:53676:112"/>
                  <p>For if we obſerve it, it is ſaid to be <hi>everlaſting Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels,
<note place="margin">Matth. 25.41.</note> Matth.</hi> 25.41. Now the <hi>Devils</hi> are ſpiritual Subſtances, and flames of <hi>Fire</hi> themſelves.
<note place="margin">Pſalm 104.4.</note> 
                     <hi>He maketh his Angels Spirits, and his Miniſters,</hi> that is his Miniſtring Spirits, whether good or evil, whether the Miniſters of his Wrath and Vengeance, or the Miniſters of his Mercy, <hi>He makes them Flames of Fire,</hi> Pſalm 104.4. They are ſuch piercing and ſubtile Flames that <hi>Lightning</hi> it ſelf is but groſs and dull compared to them: Yet here is a <hi>Fire</hi> that ſhall even torture <hi>Fire</hi> it ſelf, a <hi>Fire</hi> that ſhall burn thoſe Flames of <hi>Fire;</hi> and that is God, who being a Spirit, and the God of Spirits, can eaſily pierce and inſinuate into the very Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of their Beings. So that
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53676:112"/>the Damned in <hi>Hell</hi> ſhall for ever find themſelves burnt up with a double <hi>Fire,</hi> a <hi>Material Fire,</hi> ſuted and adapted to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Pain and Torment upon the Body, yet without waſting and conſuming it; And an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible intellectual Fire,</hi> that ſhall prey upon the Soul, and fill it with unſpeakable Anguiſh and Horror, and this is no other than God himſelf.</p>
                  <p>And in this there is a true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel between <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell;</hi> for as in <hi>Heaven,</hi> though there are many created Excellencies and Glories which contribute to the <hi>Beatitude</hi> of the Saints, yet their moſt ſubſtantial Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is derived from their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate fruition of God: So likewiſe in <hi>Hell,</hi> though there be many created and (if I may ſo call them) many invented

                     <hi>Tortures,</hi> yet the higheſt and moſt intolerable Miſery of the Damned, is from the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate infliction and infuſion of the Divine Wrath into them, which no Creature doth or can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey to them in ſuch a Manner and Meaſure as they there feel it, but God himſelf pours the full Vials of it into their Souls. And therefore as the Saints are called <hi>Veſſels of Mercy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 9.22.</note> ſo the Wicked are called <hi>Veſſels of Wrath, fitted for Deſtruction,</hi> Rom. 9.22. Such Veſſels into which God will pour in of his Vengeance, and fill brimm-full with his Wrath and Fury for ever.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.9. ſpeaking of wicked Men, tells us,

                  <p>And thus much briefly for the <hi>firſt</hi> Thing obſervable in

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Conſider that all other Vengeance is as nothing in compariſon of that which God takes on a damned Soul. You
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53676:114"/>may poſſibly have heard of ſtrange and horrid Revenges that ſome cruel Men have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out unto themſelves, putting thoſe that have offended them to ſuch Tortures as were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unfit for Men either to inflict or ſuffer. All <hi>Hiſtories</hi> abound with ſuch <hi>Barbarities.</hi> I am loth to offend your Ears ſo much as to recount them, let us only take an eſtimate by the dreadful Revenge that <hi>David</hi> took on the <hi>Ammonites:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12. laſt.</note> 2 <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> 12. laſt. where it is ſaid, <hi>He put them under Saws, and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of Iron, and made them paſs thorow the Brick-Kilns.</hi> And all this Severity, (if not to ſay Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty) was to revenge the inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Affront done to his <hi>Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours.</hi> It is doubtleſs no ſmall Torture to be burnt alive, for Fire is a ſearching Thing, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53676:115"/>eats deep into the Senſes; but yet this kind of Death was a quick and merciful diſpatch in compariſon of the others: Think what it is to be ſtretcht along, and to have the ſharp ſpikes of an Harrow tare up your Fleſh, and draw out your Bowels and Bones after them: Or what it is to be ſawn aſunder in the midſt, and to have thoſe ſmall Teeth eat their way ſlowly thorow you, while they jarr a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your Bones, and pull out your Nerves and Sinews thread by thread. How many <hi>Deaths</hi> think you were theſe poor mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Creatures compelled to ſuffer before they were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to die. Yet alas! theſe, and all the witty Tortures that ever were invented by the greateſt Maſters of Cruelty, are nothing in compariſon of the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53676:115"/>Vengeance that God will take upon Sinners in <hi>Hell:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſays, <hi>Vengeance is mine, I will recompence.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, alas, all that you can do one to another ſignifies nothing, it is not to be called, nor accounted <hi>Vengeance,</hi> that is too great a Name for ſuch poor Effects. It is a Prerogative that God chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth to himſelf to be the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger:</hi> And whatever Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures meddle with, if they have not a Commiſſion from him, it is their Sin; and therefore private Perſons, whom he hath not inveſted with any ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ought not to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to avenge their own cauſe. Or if they have a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, yet all their execution of <hi>Vengeance</hi> is but feeble and weak. We find in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory</hi> that the <hi>Holy Martyrs</hi> have often
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53676:116"/>mockt at all the <hi>cruel Tortures</hi> of their inraged <hi>Perſecutors,</hi> and God hath either taken from them all ſenſe of their Pain, or elſe given them in ſuch ſtrong Conſolations, that they have triumph'd and exulted in all the Extremity of them; O how have they hugg'd the <hi>Stake</hi> at which they were to be burnt, courted the <hi>Beaſts</hi> that were to devour them, and been ſtretched upon the <hi>Rack</hi> with as much content, as formerly they have ſtretcht themſelves upon their Beds; and not ſo much ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, as enjoyed their Deaths! God hath ſo mercifully taken off the Edg and Keeneſs of their <hi>Torments,</hi> to ſhew that <hi>Vengeance</hi> is his Right and Due, and that they are but contemptible things that one Man can inflict upon another, ſcarce worthy to be
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53676:116"/>called <hi>Vengeance.</hi> And beſides, let it be never ſo ſharp and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, yet it cannot be long du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; the more intolerable any <hi>Torments</hi> are, the ſooner do they work our eſcape from them. And though Spite and Malice may wiſh the Perpetuity of our Pain, yet it is not poſſible for mortal Men to proſecute an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Revenge, the Death, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, or our ſelves, will put a period to our Sufferings. And what a ſmall matter is it to undergo pain for a few days only, this is not worthy to be called <hi>Vengeance,</hi> nor is it like that which the great God will inflict which is both inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and eternal.

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi>  The Apoſtle calls it <hi>a falling into the Hands of the Living God.</hi> And this denotes to us the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53676:117"/>Perpetuity and Eternity of this <hi>Vengeance.</hi> God for ever lives to inflict it, and Sinners ſhall for ever live to ſuffer it; for they fall into his Hands. God hath, as it were, leaſed out a Life to every wicked Man, he hath his Term of Years ſet him, wherein he lives to himſelf, enjoying his Luſts, and the Pleaſures and Profits of this preſent World; and all this while <hi>Vengeance</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medles but little with him: but when his Life is expir'd, and his Years run out, he then falls into the Hands of the great Lord of all, and becomes the Poſſeſſion of his <hi>Vengeance</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> for ever. And then, <hi>he is the Living God,</hi> and ſuch wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Wretches muſt for ever live to endure the moſt dreadful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of his Power and Wrath. Were there any Term or Period

He is a conſuming <hi>Fire,</hi> but yet ſpends not any part of his Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53676:118"/>he conſumes without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing them, and deſtroys, but yet ſtill perpetuates their being. A wiſe and intelligent Fire, (as <hi>Minutius</hi> calls him) that devours the Damned, but yet ſtill repairs them, and by tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting ſtill nouriſhes them for future Torments. <hi>Sapiens ille ignis, urit &amp; reficit, carpit &amp; nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trit.</hi> And when they have lain burning in this <hi>Fire</hi> all the Ages that <hi>Arithmetick</hi> can ſum up, Millions after Thouſands, and Thouſands of Millions, yet ſtill it is but the beginning of their Sorrows. O think with your ſelves how long and tedious a little time ſeems to you when you are in pain, you complain then that Time hath leaden Feet, and wiſh the Days and Hours would roll away faſter with you, and you never find
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:53676:118"/>them ſo ſlow paced, as when they paſs over a <hi>ſick Bed.</hi> Oh then what will it be when you ſhall lie ſweltring under the <hi>dread Wrath and Vengeance of the living God,</hi> the intolerableneſs of your Pain and Torment will make every Day ſeem an Age, and every Year as long as Eternity, and yet you muſt lie there an Eternity of thoſe long Years. Me thinks this conſideration of <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Torments</hi> ſhould aſtoniſh the Heart, and ſink the Spirits of every wicked Wretch; for though they were not to be ſo exceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſharp as they are, yet the <hi>Eternity</hi> of them, is that which ſhould make them altogether intolerable. There is ſcarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pain ſo ſmall but it would make us deſperate, were we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured it would never wear off, that we ſhould never obtain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

What ever Pain we ſuffer, our uſual incouragement unto Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience is, that ſhortly it will be over: But now in <hi>Hell</hi> there is no period fixt to their <hi>Torments,</hi> they are all eternal, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatſoever they are for the Degree and Meaſure of them, yet are they utterly intolerable, at leaſt for their Duration and Continuance. Couldſt thou ſhove away Millions of Years with a Wiſh, yet all this would avail nothing; for there are as many Years in Eternity as there are Moments, and as many Millions of Years as there are Years, that is, it is an infinite and boundleſs Duration, and when thou haſt ſtruck thy Thoughts as deep into it as thou canſt, yet ſtill thou art but at the top of the heap, and it is

<note place="margin">2 Sam. 24.14.</note> Indeed we read in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.14. that <hi>David</hi> choſe rather <hi>to fall into the Hands of the Lord, than into the Hands of Men.</hi> It is true, when there is true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and hopes of obtaining Mercy, this is far more eligible: for the Chaſtiſements of the Lord are full of Mercy; but the tender Mercies of the wicked are
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53676:125"/>cruel. But where all hopes and expectations of Mercy are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, as they are in Hell, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly there it is infinitely more dreadful to fall into the Hands of a Sin-revenging-God, than into the Hands of all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Heaven, or Earth, yea or Hell it ſelf. One would have thought it had been terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enough, if the Apoſtle had ſaid, It is a fearful thing to fall into the Hands of <hi>Devils,</hi> and ſo indeed it were, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der either their Power, or their Malice: Certainly they can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily find out ſuch tormenting Ingredients, and apply them alſo to ſuch tender Parts, that it would tranſcend the Patience of any Man on Earth quietly to bear but what one <hi>Devil</hi> can inflict. Do we not often ſee in the Illuſions of black and

And all this he can do out of his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; what then can he do when he hath got Sinners into his own Territories, and under his own Dominions? What exact Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures can he inflict upon them there? ſuch indeed as we cannot tell what they are, and may it pleaſe God we never may.</p>
                  <p>And yet the <hi>Devil</hi> is but a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Creature; but wicked Men are to fall into the Hands, not of a Creature, but of the great
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53676:126"/>Creatour, into the Hands of God himſelf, whoſe Power is infinitely beyond the Devils, ſo that he is the Tormentor even of them.</p>
                  <p>Think then with thy ſelf <hi>O Sinner,</hi> that if God binds and ſcourges, and torments the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Devils, who yet do ſo inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferably torment the Damned, how infinitely intollerable then is that Wrath which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhall inflict upon them?

                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:53676:127"/>
                  <p>Nay let me go yet a great deal lower; and ſuppoſe that God ſhould make uſe of common and ordinary Creatures for the puniſhment of wicked Men, who is there that could bear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven this? If God ſhould only keep a Man living for ever in the midſt of a Furnace of groſs and earthly Fire, how dreadful would this be! If but a Spark of Fire fall upon any part of the Body, conſider what an acute Pain it will cauſe, much more if thy whole Man ſhould be all over on a light Flame, and thou for ever kept alive to feel the pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Torment of it. And yet what is our dull unactive Fire in compariſon of that pure intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Fire, which ſhall melt down the Damned like Wax, and lick up the very Spirits of their Souls? Or ſuppoſe God
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53676:127"/>who knows the ſeveral Stings that are in all his Creatures, ſhould take out of them the moſt ſharp Ingredients, and from them all make up a moſt tormenting Compoſition; if he ſhould take Poiſon and Venome out of one, and Fire and Scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of another, and Smart and Stinging out of a third, and the Quinteſſence of Bitterneſs out of a fourth; and by his infinite Skill, heighten all theſe to a preternatural Acrimony; if now God ſhould apply this Compoſition thus fatally mixed and blended together, unto any of us, what an intollerable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh would it cauſe in us? And if Creatures can cauſe ſuch Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, what a dreadful thing then is it to fall into the Hands of God himſelf? For when God conveys his Wrath to us by
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53676:128"/>Creatures, it muſt needs loſe infinitely in the very Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi>  Our Lord Chriſt was ſupported under all his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by the ineffable Union of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:53676:132"/>the <hi>Deity.</hi> He had infinite Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer for him, as well as againſt him; infinite Power to bear him up, as well as to cruſh him. In Chriſt's Sufferings, the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God ſeem'd as it were to encounter with it ſelf, and to run contrary to it ſelf in the ſame Channel. And as he had the ſupport of infinite Power in his Sufferings, ſo likewiſe had he in the greateſt of his Angonies the Miniſtry of <hi>Angels</hi> to comfort him, and to refreſh the Droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Faintings of his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature.

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi>  The infinite Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt's Perſon, being God as well as Man, might well compound for the Rigour of his Puniſhments, and ſtamp ſuch a Value upon his Humiliation, that leſs degrees of Suffering from him, might be fully ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53676:133"/>For indeed it cannot be but an infinite Puniſhment, for an infinite Perſon to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. But thou that art but a vile contemptible Creature, made up of Mudd and Slime, haſt nothing in thy Nature wherewith to ſatisfy the dread Juſtice of God, but only the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Deſtruction and Perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. Thou haſt no Worth nor Dignity, the conſideration whereof might perſwade the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to mitigate the leaſt of his Wrath and Fury upon thee: And when it falls in all its weight and force upon thee, thou haſt nothing to uphold or ſupport thee. It is true, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power of God ſhall continue thee in thy Being, but thou wilt for ever curſe and blaſpeme that Support, that ſhall be given thee only to perpetuate
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:53676:133"/>thy Torments, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times wiſh that God would deſtroy thee once for all, and that thou mighteſt for ever ſhrink away into nothing: but that, alas, poor miſerable Wretch will not be granted thee; no, thou ſhalt not have ſo much as the relief and comfort of dying, nor eſcape the Vengeance of God by Annihilation: but his Power will for ever ſo ſupport thee, as for ever to torment thee, which is only ſuch a Support as a Man is ſupported on the <hi>Rack</hi> or on the <hi>Wheel,</hi> ſupported ſo as they cannot come off, the very Engine of their Torture upholds them. And as for any help or relief the Miniſtry of Angels will afford thee, think what ſolace it will bring thee, when God ſhall ſet on whole Legions of <hi>infernal Ghoſts,</hi> black
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:53676:134"/>and hideous Spirits, as the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners of his Wrath, who ſhall for ever triumph in thy Woes and add to them, hurl Fire-brands at thee, heap fewel about thee, and fully ſatiate their Malice upon thee, as God ſatisfies his Juſtice. And this is one <hi>Conſideration</hi> of the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of this Vengeance, in that it aims at and exacts ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for Sin, which will be infinitely intolerable, becauſe our Sins are infinite both in Number and Heinouſneſs. And becauſe Jeſus Chriſt, who was to ſatisfy not for his own, but for the Sins of others, though he were upheld by the <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and poſſibly underwent not ſuch Acrimony of Wrath as the Damned do, yet his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings were unſpeakable and unknown Sorrows: And how
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53676:134"/>much ſorer then ſhall wicked Men bear for their own Sins, when Juſtice ſhall come to reckon with them, and to exact from them to the very utmoſt Farthing of all that they owe?</p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi>  Conſider that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging Wrath</hi> ſtirs up all that is in God againſt a Sinner. <hi>Wrath</hi> when it is whet and ſet on by <hi>Revenge,</hi> redoubles a Man's Force, and makes him perform Things that he could not do in his cold Blood, it fires all a Man's Spirits, and calls them forth to expreſs their utmoſt Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts. So this <hi>Revenging Wrath</hi> of God draws forth all the Force and Activity of his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, and ſets them againſt a Sinner, and how dreadful then muſt that Execution needs be? We ſee what great Works God can perform when he is not ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53676:135"/>up thereunto by his Wrath and Indignation. He ſpeaks a whole World into Being, and ſpeaks it with a cold and calm Breath. Certainly it was no ſmall peice of work, to ſpread out the Heavens, and lay the Foundations of the Earth, and to work all thoſe Wonders of <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> which we daily behold; but yet all theſe Things God did, (if I may ſo ſpeak) without any Emotion. But when he comes to take <hi>Vengeance</hi> upon Sinners, he is then inflamed, all that is in God, is as it were on fire. <hi>Jealouſy,</hi> ſays <hi>Solomon, is the Rage of a Man, Proverbs</hi> 6.34.
<note place="margin">Prov. 6.34.</note> Now when God's Jealouſy ſhall be ſtirred in him, think how impetuouſly it will break forth in the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effects of it.
<note place="margin">Iſa. 42.13.</note> Iſa. 42.13. <hi>The Lord ſhall ſtir up Jealouſy
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:53676:135"/>like a Man of War; he ſhall cry, yea, roar, he ſhall prevail againſt his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</hi> If the calm and ſedate Works of God are ſo great and wonderful, how great then will his <hi>Vengeance</hi> be, when Anger, Fury, and Indignation ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite and whet his Power to ſhew the very utmoſt of what it can do? And therefore we find that though God had inflicted dreadful Plagues upon the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs, and had ſhewn mighty effects of his Power and Vengeance, yet we find the <hi>Church</hi> bleſſeth him, <hi>That he turned away his Anger, and did not ſtir up all his Wrath.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 78.38.</note> But in <hi>Hell</hi> God ſtirs up all his Wrath, every thing is ſet and bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Damned: And as to the <hi>Saints</hi> in Heaven, every At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of God concurs to make him merciful and gracious to
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:53676:136"/>them. So to the Wicked in <hi>Hell,</hi> all the Perfections of God conſpire either to ſtir up and kindle his Wrath, or elſe to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him in the execution of it upon them. The infinite <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of God contrives their Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, and which way to lay them on, ſo that they ſhall be moſt ſharp and poinant. The <hi>Power</hi> of God that rouſes it ſelf againſt them, and proffers all its Succours and Aſſiſtance unto <hi>Vengeance.</hi> The <hi>Eternity</hi> and <hi>Unchangeableneſs</hi> of God come in as a dreadful Addition, and makes that Wrath which of it ſelf is inſupportable, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo everlaſting? Yea that ſweet and mild Attribute of God, his <hi>Mercy,</hi> the only Refuge and the only comfort of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Mankind, yet even this turns againſt them too, and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53676:136"/>becauſe they deſpiſed it when it ſhone forth in Patience and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, will not now regard them when they ſtand in need of its Reſcue and Deliverance: So that all that is in God, arms it ſelf to take <hi>Vengeance</hi> on Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: And O think how ſore and fearful that Vengeance will be, when God ſhall put forth all that is in himſelf for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of his Wrath upon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent Sinners! And thus I have done with the <hi>Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of the Dreadfulneſs of God's Wrath taken from the Words in the Text, <hi>Vengeance is mine, I will recompence it.

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi>  Another <hi>Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the dreadfulneſs of this Vengeance is this, That it is a Wrath that ſhall come up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and equal all our Fears. You know what an inventive and ingenious thing Fear is, what horrid Shapes it can fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to it ſelf out of every thing: Put but an active Fancy into an Affright, and preſently the whole World will be filled
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53676:139"/>with ſtrange Monſters and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous Apparitions. The very ſhaking of a leaf will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times rout all the Forces and Reſolutions of Men: And u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually it is this wild Paſſion that doth inhance all other Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and make them ſeem greater and more dreadful than indeed they are. But now here it is impoſſible for a wicked Man to fear more than he ſhall certainly ſuffer. Let his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations be hung round with all the diſmal Shapes that ever frighted Men out of their Wits; let his Fancy dip its Pencil in the deepeſt Melancholy that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any Soul was beſmeered with, and then ſtrive to pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray and expreſs the moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible things that it can judge to be the <hi>Objects</hi> of Fear, or the Inſtruments of <hi>Torment,</hi> yet the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53676:140"/>Wrath of the great God vaſtly exceeds all that Fear it ſelf can poſſibly repreſent. See that ſtrange Expreſſion, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 90.11. <hi>Who knows the Power of thine Anger? according to thy Fear, ſo is thy Wrath.</hi> That is, according to the fear Men have of thee, as dreadful and as terrible as they can poſſibly apprehend thy <hi>Wrath</hi> to be, ſo it is, and much more. Let the Heart of Man ſtretch it ſelf to the utmoſt bounds of Imagination, and call into its Aid all the things that ever it hath heard or ſeen to be dreadful; let it (as that Painter, who to make a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Piece, borrowed ſeveral of the beſt Features from ſeveral beautiful Perſons) borrow all the dreadful, all the direful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations that ever it met with, to make up one moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53676:140"/>
                     <hi>Idea;</hi> yet the Wrath of God ſhall ſtill exceed it: He can execute more Wrath upon us than we can fear. Some wicked Men in this Life have had a Spark of this Wrath of God fall upon their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when they lye roaring out under Deſpair and fearful Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of the fiery Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God to conſume and devour them. But alas this is nothing to what they ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after feel. God now doth but open to them a ſmall chink and crevice into <hi>Hell,</hi> he now doth but ſuffer a few ſmall drops of his Wrath to fall upon them. And if this be ſo ſore and ſmart that their Fears could never think of any thing more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than what they now ſuffer: O what will it be then when he ſhall overwhelm them with
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53676:141"/>a whole deluge of his Wrath, and cauſe all his Waves to go over them? <hi>Fear him,</hi> ſays our Saviour, <hi>who is able to deſtroy both Soul and Body in Hell; yea, I ſay unto you,
<note place="margin">Mat. 10.28.</note> fear him.</hi> And yet when we have feared ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the utmoſt extent of our narrow Hearts, yet ſtill his infinite Power and Wrath is infinitely more fearful than we can fear it.</p>

                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi>  Conſider the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal and immediate Subject of this Wrath of God, and that is the <hi>Soul,</hi> and this adds much to the dreadfulneſs of it. The acuteſt Torments that the <hi>Body</hi> is capable of, are but dull and flat things in compariſon of what the <hi>Soul</hi> can feel. Now when God ſhall immediately with his own Hand laſh the Soul, that refined and ſpiritual
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53676:141"/>Part of Man, the principle of all Life and Senſation, and ſhall draw Blood from it every Stripe, how intolerable may we conceive thoſe Pains and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be? To ſhoot poiſon'd Darts into a Man's Marrow, to rip up his Bowels with a Sword red hot; all this is as nothing to it. Think what it is to have a drop of ſcalding Oyl, or mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Lead, fall upon the Apple of your Eyes, that ſhould make them boyl and burn till they fall out of your Heads; ſuch Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nay infinitely more than ſuch, is it to have the burning Wrath of God to fall upon the Soul. We find that Spirits which are infinitely inferiour unto God, can make ſtrange Impreſſions upon the Souls of Men: and ſhall not the great God much more, who is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:53676:142"/>of Spirits? Yes, he can torture them by his eſſential Wrath. And that God, who, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Nahum</hi> ſpeaks,
<note place="margin">Nahum 1.6.</note> 
                     <hi>can melt Mountains, and make Hills and Rocks flow down at his Preſence,</hi> can melt the Souls of the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, like lumps of Wax; for in his Diſpleaſure he doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do it to the beſt of Men even in this Life,

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi>  The Dreadfulneſs of this Wrath of God may be demonſtrated by this, That the Puniſhment of the Damned is reſerved by God as his laſt Work. It is a Work which he will ſet himſelf about when all the reſt of his Works are done, when he hath folded up the World, and laid it aſide as a Thing of no further uſe, then
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:53676:142"/>will God ſet himſelf to this great Work, and pour out all the Treaſures of his Wrath upon damned Wretches, as if God would ſo wholly mind this Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs that he would lay all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Affairs aſide, that he might be intent only upon this, having no other thing to interrupt him. Think then how full of Dread and Terror this muſt needs be, when God will as it were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all his <hi>Eternity</hi> about this, and have no other thing to take him off from doing it with all his Might. God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved two Works, and but two for the other World; One is the <hi>Salvation of the Elect,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the <hi>Damnation of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates.</hi>
                  </p>

So uſually the laſt Works of God are more compleat, perfect and excellent than the former. Now God's puniſhing-Work is his laſt Work, and therefore it ſhall exceed in Greatneſs all that ever went before it. In his firſt Work, the Creation of the World, he demonſtrated his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Power, Wiſdom, and Godhead; but in the Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sinners, which is his laſt Work, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53676:144"/>appear in one, he may mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt it in another. But when he ſhall confine himſelf only to two, as he will in the World to come, the ſaving of the Godly, and the damning of the Wicked, and this without any variety or change, certainly then theſe ſhall be performed to the very ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of what God can do: for as he will ſave the Saints to the very utmoſt; ſo likewiſe will he damn and deſtroy Sinners to the very utmoſt.</p>

                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi>  Another Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the dreadfulneſs of this Wrath ſhall be drawn from this Conſideration, That God will for ever inflict it for the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of his Power on the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. <hi>What if God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſhew his Wrath, and make his Power known:</hi> And 2 Theſſ. 1.9. <hi>They ſhall be puniſh'd with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what Power it was for God to lay the Beams of the World, and to erect ſo ſtately a Fabrick as Heaven and Earth. The Apoſtle therefore tells us, That <hi>by the Creation of the World, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the eternal Power of God, Rom.</hi> 1.20.

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi>  Conſider God can eaſily deſtroy a Creature with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhewing any great Power, or putting forth his Almighty Arm and Strength to do it. If he only withdraw his Power by which he upholds all things in their Beings, we ſhould quickly fall all abroad into nothing: So eaſy is it for God to deſtroy the well-being of all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

Alas we are cruſht before the Moth, and muſt needs
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53676:145"/>periſh, if God doth but ſuſpend the influence of his Power from us. How dreadfully then will he deſtroy when he ſhall lay forth his infinite Power to do it, who can eaſily do it without Power?</p>
                  <p>And thus I have laid down ſome <hi>Demonſtrations</hi> of the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the Wrath and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of God, five of them drawn from the Words of the <hi>Text,</hi> and five drawn from other Conſiderations. I ſhall now ſhut up with two or three Words of Application.</p>

Then be perſwaded to believe that there is ſuch a dreadful Wrath to come. I know well, you all profeſs that you do believe, that as there are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable Rewards of Glory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in <hi>Heaven</hi> for the Saints, ſo that there are inexhauſtible Treaſures of Wrath reſerved and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53676:146"/>laid up in <hi>Hell</hi> for all ungodly and impenitent Sinners. But O how few are there that do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and cordially believe theſe things: Mens own Lives may be evident Convictions to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their Atheiſm and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity: For the true reaſon of all that diſſoluteneſs which we ſee abroad in the World proceeds much from hence, becauſe Men are not perſwaded that theſe dreadful Terrors of the Lord which have now been ſet before us, are any thing but an honeſt Artifice. They look upon them as things only invented to ſcare the World into good order, and to awe Men into ſome compaſs of Civility and Honeſty: They think all thoſe tremendous Threatnings that God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in his Law to be things intended rather to fright Men
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53676:146"/>than to do execution upon them. And whereas one of the moſt effectual Motives to Piety and an holy Life, is to be perſwaded of the Terrors of the Lord, theſe are not yet perſwaded that there are any ſuch Terrors: But aſſure your ſelves theſe are not the extravagant Dreams of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Fancies,</hi> nor the Politick Impoſtures of Men that deſign to amuſe the World with fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Stories; but they are ſad and ſerious Truths, ſuch as however you may now ſlight &amp; contemn, yet ſhall you be wofully convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of by your own experience, when after a few years, or poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly a few days, you ſhall be ſunk down into that Place of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that Gulph and Abyſs of Miſery, where the great God ſhall for ever expreſs the Art, and the Power of his Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

This ſpeaks abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of comfort to all thoſe whoſe Sins are pardon'd, and they delivered from the Wrath to come. Look what Spring-tides of Joy would riſe in the Heart of a poor condemned <hi>Malefactor,</hi> who every moment expects the ſtroke of Juſtice to cut him off, to have a Pardon interpoſe and reſcue him from Death. Such, yea far greater ſhould be thy Joy who art freed meerly by a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Pardon, from a Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion infinitely greater and worſe than Death it ſelf. When we look into <hi>Hell,</hi> and conſider the Wrath that the Damned there lye under, O to behold them there reſtleſly rolling to and fro in Chains and Flames, to hear them exclaim againſt their own
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53676:147"/>Folly and Madneſs, and to curſe Themſelves and their Aſſociates as the cauſes of their heavy and doleful Torments; how ſhould we rejoice that though we have been guilty of many great and heinous Sins, and have ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times deſerved <hi>Hell</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Burnings, yet our good and gracious God hath freely pardon'd us our Debts, and freed us from the ſame merited Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.</p>

This alſo ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us to magnify the Love of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt towards us, who though he knew what the dreadful Wrath of God was, how ſore and heavy it would lye upon his Soul, yet ſuch was his infinite Compaſſion towards us, that he willingly ſubmitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be in our ſtead, took upon him our Nature, that he might
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53676:148"/>take upon him our Guilt; and firſt made himſelf wretched, that he might be made accurſed. He drank off the whole bitter Cup of his Father's Wrath at one bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter draught, received the whole ſting of Death into his Body at once; falls and dies under the Revenges of Divine Juſtice, only that we might be delivered from the Wrath that we had deſerved, but could not bear. O Chriſtian, let thy Heart be inlarged with great Love and Thankfulneſs to thy bleſſed Redeemer; and as he thought nothing too much to ſuffer for thee, return him this Expreſſion of thy Thankfulneſs to think nothing too much, nor too hard to do or to ſuffer for him.</p>

You that go on in Sin, conſider what a God you have to deal withal; You have not to do with Creatures, but with God

And tell me now, <hi>O Sinner,</hi> wouldſt thou willingly fall into the Hands of this God, who is thus able to cruſh thee to pieces, yea to nothing? O how ſhall any of us then dare, who are but poor weak Potſherds of the Earth, daſh our ſelves againſt this Rock of Ages? Indeed we can neither reſiſt his Power, nor eſcape his Hand: and therefore ſince we muſt neceſſarily ſooner or later fall into the Hands of God, let us by true Repentance and an humble Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Sins and Vileneſs, throw our ſelves into his merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Hands, and then to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Comfort we ſhall find that he will extend his Arm of Mercy to ſupport us, and not his Hand of Juſtice to cruſh and break us.</p>
